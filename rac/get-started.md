# 🚀 Getting Started with RaC (Requirements-as-Code) in **CUE**

Welcome to your **RaC + CUE workspace**!
This setup uses a **single `rac.cue` file** as a **declarative source of truth** for your entire project — ready for AI assistants and tools like Windsurf to build, simulate, and validate your ideas.

Let RaC help your AI **"cook" your app** step by step.

## 🧠 What is RaC?

**Requirements-as-Code (RaC)** is a **tech-agnostic, declarative approach** to software design.
Instead of scattering specifications across diagrams, docs, and code, RaC consolidates everything into **a single structured model** that:

* Encodes **state**, **events**, **logic**, **UI**, **tests**, and **bindings**
* Acts as **the source of truth** for humans, AI, and tools
* Enables **validation, simulation, and generation** from one file

With **CUE**, this structure becomes:

* **Machine-readable** and strictly validated
* **AI-friendly** for tools like Windsurf, Cursor, or Bolt.new
* **Easy to extend** without breaking existing logic

---

## 📂 Project Structure (Single File Mode)

Unlike the YAML version (which had multiple folders), here **everything lives inside `rac.cue`**:

```
my-rac-project/
├── rac.cue          # Unified RaC schemas + project definitions
├── get-started.md   # This guide
└── README.md        # (Optional) Project notes
```

---

## 📚 Using `rac.cue` as Your Declarative Model

### 1️⃣ **Schemas Are Built-In**

The `rac.cue` file defines schemas for:

* `#State` — data structures
* `#Event` — user/system actions
* `#Logic` — business rules and validation
* `#UI` — abstract UI components
* `#Test` — simulations
* `#Binding` — technology mappings

These schemas enforce **consistency and correctness**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Define Your System under `RacSystem`**

You build your project by adding objects to `RacSystem`:

```cue
RacSystem: {
    states: [{
        id: "task"
        type: "object"
        fields: [
            { name: "title", type: "string", required: true },
            { name: "done",  type: "boolean" }
        ]
    }]
}
```

As you add more states, events, logic, UI, tests, and bindings, the schema ensures validity.

---

### 3️⃣ **Validate Anytime**

Install [CUE](https://cuelang.org/):

```bash
go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest
```

Then run:

```bash
cue vet rac.cue
```

* ✅ **Pass** → Your model is valid
* ❌ **Error** → Fix the reported issues

---

## ✅ Functional Scope (With CUE)

* Define **frontend and backend logic** consistently
* Support **sync and async event flows**
* Represent **state changes** declaratively
* Track **data flow** between components
* Keep everything **framework-agnostic**

---

## 🔐 Security & Monitoring

* Express **access control** and **security checks** in logic sections
* Keep sensitive actions explicitly gated (e.g., `"requires: admin"`)
* Use declarative metadata for auditing and versioning

---

## 🧪 Testing & Documentation

* Define tests under `tests:` in `RacSystem`
* Simulate flows declaratively before coding
* Document behavior inline or in separate `docs/` if needed

---

## 📦 Tech-Agnostic Bindings

* Add bindings under `bindings:` to map RaC to technologies (React, Express, Firebase, etc.)
* Keep bindings **modular and swappable**

---

## 💡 Why Use This Approach?

* ✅ **Single source of truth** — one file for your whole system
* ✅ **Declarative clarity** — no imperative code inside RaC
* ✅ **LLM-ready** — ideal input for AI IDEs like Windsurf
* ✅ **Validation built-in** — prevent inconsistencies early

---

## 🌟 How to Use It in Windsurf

1. Open your project folder in Windsurf.
2. Load `rac.cue` and start editing under `RacSystem`.
3. Ask the AI:

   * *"Add a new event for user login"*
   * *"Extend the state with profile data"*
   * *"Generate tests for the registration flow"*
4. Run `cue vet rac.cue` regularly to validate.
5. When ready, bind to tech stacks or generate code.

---

## 🧠 Progressive Workflow

1. **Model** → Add states, events, logic, UI, tests
2. **Validate** → `cue vet` ensures correctness
3. **Simulate** → Ask AI to reason about flows
4. **Generate** → Bindings → Code → Deployment

---

## ✅ You Must:

* Keep definitions **declarative**
* Extend without breaking existing logic
* Use CUE’s validation to ensure integrity
* Treat `rac.cue` as the **single source of truth**

---

> *“RaC + CUE transforms your AI IDE into a system builder — where logic is not buried in code, but clearly declared and continuously validated.”*

---

### ✅ Next Steps

* Start modeling **states** now in `rac.cue`.
* Use Windsurf AI to help you generate events, logic, and tests.
* Validate frequently and keep refining.

🔥 **You’re ready to build your entire system declaratively with a single file!**
