## 🎯 System Overview

### Architecture Pattern: **Intent-to-Workflow Automation**

1. **Intent Capture** (Frontend) - Chat-based interface for natural language automation requests
2. **Intent Analysis** (Backend) - LLM-powered requirement extraction and workflow generation  
3. **MCP Server** (Reused) - Battle-tested Google Workspace API proxy
4. **Workflow Engine** - Dynamic CUE workflow execution

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Describe automation goals in plain English
- **Intelligent Workflow Generation**: LLM creates CUE workflow specifications
- **Proven MCP Infrastructure**: Reuses tested Google Workspace integrations
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatically matches available tools to user intent
- **Interactive Workflow Builder**: Review and approve generated workflows
- **Reusable Workflow Library**: Store and reuse successful automations

## 📋 Example Scenarios

### Email Campaign Automation
**User Intent**: *"I want to send personalized emails to my client list and track responses"*

**Generated Workflow**:
1. Find client contact list in Google Drive
2. Send personalized emails via Gmail
3. Create response tracking document
4. Schedule follow-up reminders in Calendar

### Document Collaboration Setup  
**User Intent**: *"Create a project folder, share it with team members, and schedule kickoff meeting"*

**Generated Workflow**:
1. Create project folder in Google Drive
2. Share folder with specified team members
3. Create project charter document
4. Schedule kickoff meeting in Calendar

## 🧠 Collaboration Methodology

This project uses an advanced **RaC-driven AI collaboration system** defined in `.windsurfrules` that enables:

### 🎯 **Architectural AI Reasoning**
- **Evidence-based decisions** - Every code change backed by examination of existing implementation
- **Zero-hallucination precision** - No assumptions, only real constraints from actual codebase
- **First-attempt accuracy** - Systematic approach eliminates correction cycles
- **Schema-driven development** - Complete type safety and validation

### 🔍 **Critical Thinking Framework**
```cue
principles: [
  "examine_existing_before_creating",
  "precision_over_apparent_success", 
  "real_constraints_over_assumptions",
  "critical_thinking_over_speed"
]
```

### ⚡ **Agent Governance System**
- **Edit Contract** - Plan → Evidence → Patch → Prove methodology
- **Discovery Gates** - Mandatory code examination before generation
- **RaC Integration** - Automatic injection of system specifications
- **Diff Discipline** - Minimal, safe changes with rollback capability

### 🎭 **Proven Results**
- **22+ green ticks** in single development sessions
- **Complete type safety** transformations without errors
- **Architectural consistency** across multi-agent systems
- **Enterprise-scale precision** with personal project agility

> The `.windsurfrules` file contains the distilled collaboration methodology that transforms AI coding from reactive generation to **architectural reasoning**.
