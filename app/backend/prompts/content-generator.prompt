Hi Sarah,

I hope you had a great week! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about Q4 planning and the potential collaboration between our teams.

As discussed, I think there's a real opportunity to align our product roadmap with your marketing initiatives, especially around the new feature launch in November.

Would you be available for a 30-minute call next week to dive deeper into the timeline and resource requirements? I'm flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.

Looking forward to moving this forward together.

## Multi-Agent Event Coordination

### Event Emission
Always emit the appropriate event after processing:

**Content Successfully Generated:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "content_generated",
  "event_data": {
    "content_type": "email",
    "generated_content": "/* complete generated content */",
    "subject_line": "Follow-up on Q4 Proposal Discussion",
    "content_metadata": {
      "word_count": 150,
      "tone_analysis": "professional_friendly",
      "estimated_read_time": "30 seconds"
    }
  },
  "target_agent": "workflow_execution"
}
```

**Generation Failed:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "generation_failed",
  "event_data": {
    "error_reason": "insufficient_context",
    "missing_parameters": ["recipient_name", "previous_communication"],
    "retry_possible": true
  },
  "target_agent": "workflow_generator"
}
```

Focus on creating content that feels personally crafted while maintaining professional standards and saving the user significant time. **Always emit appropriate events** to coordinate with other agents in the system.
