# Custom GPT – Intent Authoring Guide (Build & Maintenance)

Generate clear, sequential intent texts for the SOHOAAS demo.

This guide explains how to build and maintain a Custom GPT that writes natural‑language intents for the SOHOAAS demo.

- Single source of truth: `rac/intent_spec.cue`
- Output format: plain text only (no JSON)
- Execution model: sequential only; no parallelism; no batch/bulk actions

---

## 1) Prerequisites
- Confirm the spec exists and is current: `rac/intent_spec.cue` (versioned)
- Know your demo’s current capabilities (derive from the spec; do not hardcode in GPT)

---

## 2) Build the Custom GPT
1) Knowledge (upload/reference)
   - Add `rac/intent_spec.cue` as the only authoritative knowledge file
   - Optionally add a read‑only mirror doc for reviewers (generated from the CUE)
2) System instructions (minimal and stable)
   - Paste:
```
You write concise, plain‑text intents for the SOHOAAS demo.
Follow the single source of truth: rac/intent_spec.cue (uploaded as Knowledge).
Rules: sequential execution; explicit ordering hints; no JSON; no service/function names; no batch/bulk; ask a single precise follow‑up if critical info is missing; adhere to examples in the spec.
Output only plain text.
```
3) Capabilities
   - Keep default reasoning, no tools required
   - Temperature: low‑medium (e.g., 0.3–0.5) for consistency

---

## 3) Authoring Guidelines (enforced by the spec)
- Include goals, outcomes, concrete details (emails, times, titles, share roles)
- Use clear ordering hints when steps depend on prior outputs
- Avoid parallelism and batch/bulk phrasing
- Ask for missing critical details in one sentence

---

## 4) Maintenance Workflow (single source of truth)
- Update capabilities → edit `rac/intent_spec.cue` (bump `version`)
- Re‑upload/sync this file in the Custom GPT Knowledge
- No changes to the GPT prompt required
- Record changes in a short changelog in the spec header comment if helpful

---

## 5) Versioning & Governance
- Track `IntentSpec.version` in `rac/intent_spec.cue`
- When bumping versions, note breaking vs. non‑breaking changes
- Keep demo constraints explicit: `execution.mode`, `execution.batch`, `parameterReferences`, examples

---

## 6) Quality Checklist (before demos)
- Spec is present and readable in Knowledge
- GPT produces:
  - Plain text only
  - Sequential intents with ordering hints
  - No explicit service/function names
  - No batch/bulk phrasing
  - Precise follow‑up when info is missing
- Try 3 smoke prompts; if drift is observed, update the spec examples (not the prompt)

---

## 7) Example Prompts (for sales/demo)
- “Draft a meeting summary for tomorrow 09:00 EEST for Alice and Bob using points: roadmap, metrics, blockers; share and email the link appropriately.”
- “Create a project kickoff doc with sections Objectives, Scope, Timeline; share with team; email link to manager with a short request for review.”
- “Schedule a 30‑minute weekly review next Thursday 10:00 EEST with the lead; create and share an agenda doc; include the doc link in the event description.”

---

## 8) Troubleshooting
- GPT outputs JSON or lists → Re‑check that the spec’s `intentTextRules.format` is in Knowledge; remind the model to output plain text
- Mentions service names → Ensure the prompt forbids explicit names; strengthen examples in the spec
- Parallel/batch phrasing → Verify `execution.mode` and `execution.batch` in the spec; add an example that rejects batching

## 9) File Map (for reference)
- `rac/intent_spec.cue` – authoritative spec (edit here)
- `docs/12.CUSTOM_GPT_INTENT_GUIDE.md` – this guide (operational)
